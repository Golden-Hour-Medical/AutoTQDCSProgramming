# AutoTQ Bulk Audio Transfer Tool

## Quick Reference Guide

### What It Does
Transfers audio files to **multiple AutoTQ devices simultaneously** using parallel threads. Instead of transferring to devices one at a time, this tool detects all connected devices and transfers to all of them at once.

### Time Savings
- **Sequential**: 10 devices √ó 60 seconds = **10 minutes**
- **Parallel**: 10 devices √∑ 1 transfer time = **~60 seconds** ‚ö°

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage (Interactive)
```bash
# Windows
run_bulk_audio.bat

# Python
python autotq_bulk_audio_transfer.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Tool detects all connected AutoTQ devices
2. Shows you which devices were found
3. Asks for confirmation
4. Transfers audio to all devices in parallel
5. Shows summary of results

### Production Mode (Automated)
```bash
# Windows - no prompts, start immediately
run_bulk_audio.bat --no-prompt

# Python - no prompts, start immediately
python autotq_bulk_audio_transfer.py --no-prompt
```

### Continuous Production Mode
```bash
# Keep running and process new batches automatically
run_bulk_audio.bat --continuous --no-prompt
```

**Perfect for:**
- Production lines
- Quality control stations
- High-volume manufacturing

## Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--no-prompt` | Skip confirmation, start immediately | `run_bulk_audio.bat --no-prompt` |
| `--speed` | Transfer speed: slow, normal, fast, ultrafast | `--speed ultrafast` |
| `--audio-dir` | Custom audio directory | `--audio-dir C:\MyAudio` |
| `--continuous` | Keep detecting and transferring to new devices | `--continuous` |

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Program 10 Devices at Once
1. Plug in all 10 devices to USB hub(s)
2. Run: `run_bulk_audio.bat`
3. Wait ~60-90 seconds
4. Done! All 10 devices have audio files

### Scenario 2: Production Line
1. Set up multiple USB ports/hubs at workstation
2. Run: `run_bulk_audio.bat --continuous --no-prompt`
3. Worker plugs in batch of devices
4. Tool auto-detects and transfers
5. Worker removes completed batch, plugs in next batch
6. Repeat continuously

### Scenario 3: Quality Control Re-Transfer
1. Connect devices that need audio updated
2. Run: `run_bulk_audio.bat --no-prompt --speed ultrafast`
3. Tool transfers to all devices simultaneously
4. Remove and process next batch

## Troubleshooting

### No Devices Detected
**Problem:** Tool reports "No AutoTQ devices detected"

**Solutions:**
1. Check USB connections
2. Make sure devices are powered on
3. Verify devices enumerate properly in Device Manager (Windows)
4. Try unplugging and re-plugging devices
5. Check that drivers are installed (run `setup_all.bat`)

### Some Transfers Failed
**Problem:** Some devices succeeded, others failed

**Solutions:**
1. Check the error message for failed devices
2. Try re-running for just the failed devices
3. Verify those devices work individually
4. Check USB cable quality
5. Try a slower transfer speed: `--speed normal`

### Transfer Too Slow
**Problem:** Transfer seems slower than expected

**Solutions:**
1. Use faster transfer speed: `--speed ultrafast`
2. Check USB hub quality (some hubs have slow bandwidth)
3. Close other USB-intensive applications
4. Ensure devices have good USB connections

### Audio Files Not Found
**Problem:** "Audio directory not found" error

**Solution:**
1. Run setup first: `setup_all.bat` or `python autotq_setup.py`
2. Or specify custom directory: `--audio-dir path/to/audio`

## Technical Details

### How Parallel Transfer Works
1. Main thread detects all connected ESP32/AutoTQ devices
2. Spawns one worker thread per device
3. Each thread independently:
   - Connects to its assigned device
   - Transfers all required audio files
   - Reports progress and results
4. Main thread waits for all workers to complete
5. Displays consolidated summary

### Thread Safety
- Each device has its own serial port connection
- No shared state between device threads
- Thread-safe result collection
- Safe for concurrent operations

### Performance Considerations
- **CPU**: Minimal - mostly waiting on I/O
- **Memory**: ~50MB + (5MB per device)
- **USB Bandwidth**: Main bottleneck
  - USB 2.0 hub: ~10-15 devices simultaneously
  - USB 3.0 hub: ~20+ devices simultaneously
- **Serial I/O**: Each device transfers at 115200 baud independently

### Audio Files Transferred
The tool transfers these required files:
1. `tightenStrap.wav`
2. `bleedingContinues.wav`
3. `pullStrapTighter.wav`
4. `inflating.wav`
5. `timeRemaining.wav`
6. `reattachStrap.wav`

## Integration with Production Workflow

### Option 1: Two-Stage Process
**Stage 1 - Firmware (Sequential):**
- Use `autotq_unified_production.py` to flash firmware one at a time
- Firmware flashing is fast (~30s) and works best sequentially

**Stage 2 - Audio (Parallel):**
- Collect all firmware-flashed devices
- Use `run_bulk_audio.bat --no-prompt` to transfer audio to all devices at once
- Audio transfer is slow (~60s) so parallel saves significant time

### Option 2: Skip Audio in Unified Tool
```bash
# Program firmware only, skip audio
run_unified.bat -y --skip-audio

# Then batch transfer audio to all devices
run_bulk_audio.bat --no-prompt
```

### Option 3: Quality Control Station
- Dedicated workstation with USB hub
- Run in continuous mode
- Workers continuously feed devices through

## Best Practices

### USB Hub Selection
- ‚úÖ **Use powered USB hubs** (don't rely on computer power)
- ‚úÖ **USB 3.0 hubs** provide better bandwidth
- ‚úÖ **Industrial-grade hubs** for reliability
- ‚ùå Avoid daisy-chaining multiple hubs

### Device Handling
1. Plug in all devices before starting transfer
2. Don't unplug devices during transfer
3. Wait for summary before removing devices
4. Label devices if tracking individual units

### Speed Settings
- **Production**: Use `fast` (default) - good balance
- **Quality Critical**: Use `normal` or `slow` - more reliable
- **Time Critical**: Use `ultrafast` - fastest but verify success rate

### Monitoring
- Watch for any failed transfers in summary
- Keep track of success rate over time
- Re-transfer to any failed devices
- Verify random samples with device testing

## FAQs

**Q: How many devices can I connect at once?**
A: Typically 10-20 devices work well. Limited by USB hub capabilities and bandwidth.

**Q: Can I use this with other AutoTQ tools?**
A: Yes! Use `autotq_unified_production.py --skip-audio` then this tool for audio.

**Q: What if one device fails?**
A: Other devices continue. Failed device shows in summary. Re-run for failed devices.

**Q: Does it work on Mac/Linux?**
A: Yes! Python script works cross-platform. Use `python3 autotq_bulk_audio_transfer.py`

**Q: Can I cancel during transfer?**
A: Yes, press Ctrl+C. Devices that completed will have audio, others won't.

**Q: How do I update audio files?**
A: Run `setup_all.bat` or `python autotq_setup.py` to download latest audio files.
